# Django + GraphQL Demo

This repository contains code that was shown at the [API Craft Singapore June Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/API-Craft-Singapore/events/239634405/).

The slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/mbrochh/using-graphql-with-django).

This repo is a simple vanilla Django project with one app called `simple_app`
and one model (called `Message`). It has the `graphql` URL hooked up so that
you can make one query and one mutation against the `Message` model.
